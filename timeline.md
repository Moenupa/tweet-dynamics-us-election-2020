	The Michigan Court of Claims dismisses Trump's lawsuit to temporarily halt the ballot counting until Republican poll watchers have sufficient access to observe it. The state court rules on grounds that filing it against the Michigan Secretary of State was improper because the office is not directly involved with that part of the local counting process. In addition, "it was filed at 4:00, at which point the count had largely proceeded".  
	The Nevada Republican Party sends a criminal referral to U.S. Attorney General Barr, alleging over 3,000 cases of voter fraud.  
	A Pennsylvania state judge grants Trump's request and allows poll watchers to observe the Philadelphia ballot counting "within 6 feet, while [still] adhering to all COVID-19 protocols" instead of being forced to observe further back.

	With the updated Pennsylvania ballot counts, the election-calling organization Decision Desk HQ announces that it now projects Biden as the winner of that state, and thus becomes the first major election reporting organization to declare that he has reached the required 270 electoral votes to be named the U.S. President-elect. Those organizations that use Decision Desk HQ's services such as Vox and Business Insider repeat the call that Biden is the winner of the election. However, the Associated Press, Fox News, and other organizations continue to list Pennsylvania as too close to call.  
	With the vote still close to call in his state, Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger says that there will likely be a recount.

	During an evening address, Biden reiterates that he is not yet claiming victory, but based on the counts, "What's becoming clear each hour is that a record number of Americans of all races, faiths and religions, chose change over more of the same. They've given us a mandate for action on COVID, the economy, on climate change and systemic racism. They made it clear they want the country to come together not continue to pull apart."

He and Harris later make evening addresses to the nation at the Chase Center in Wilmington, with Biden saying "This is the time to heal in America".  
	Refusing to concede, Trump proceeds with his legal challenges, releasing a statement saying that "this election is far from over. Joe Biden has not been certified as the winner of any states, let alone any of the highly contested states headed for mandatory recounts, or states where our campaign has valid and legitimate legal challenges that could determine the ultimate victor ... until the American People have the honest vote count they deserve and that Democracy demands".
